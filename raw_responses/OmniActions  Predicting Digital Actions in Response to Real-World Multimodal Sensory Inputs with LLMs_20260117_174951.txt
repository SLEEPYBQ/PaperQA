## computational_modelling
Answer: Formative Study (Diary study-driven); Details: The pipeline and action prediction are grounded in an empirically derived design space of follow-up actions from a formative workshop and a five-day diary study (7 general and 17 specific action categories), which guides the LLM’s predictions.
Source: “Figure 1: OmniActions contributes: (1) a design space of digital follow-up actions (b) derived from data collected during a fve-day diary study with 39 participants (a), and (2) a pipeline that takes multimodal sensory data (c) and contextual information (d) as inputs, and predicts what digital actions users might take… The action prediction is guided by the design space.”; “To bridge this gap, we ran a formative workshop followed by a diary study to collect and identify the actions people might take when interacting with multimodal information.”; “The collected data was then used to inform the creation of a design space of possible follow-up actions…”; “The design space was then used to inform the design of a prototype called OmniActions…”; “Following the diary study… The resulting action space consisted of 7 general categories of follow-up actions… These categories were further divided into 17 specifc categories (Figure 7).”; “OmniActions… predicts the target information and follow-up actions grounded in the action space, which is based on the empirical data.”
